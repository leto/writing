* Please give a detailed description of the project.

Parrot Virtual Machine is a portable register-based application virtual machine
intended as a research platform for dynamic languages as well as having the
goal of allowing "language interoperability", i.e. the ability of one language
running on Parrot (usually called a High Level Language (HLL)) to use libraries
from another language.

* What FLOSS License(s) does your project use?  Please include the
primary license, and list other licenses for code that is included.
(e.g., "The project as a whole is GPLv3-or-later, but about a dozen
files in the directory src/external/ are under the Apache-2.0
license")

All core code is Artistic 2.0. All external code that is bundled with
Parrot is the in the ext/ directory.

* Please give us your roadmap and plans for future development of the
project, including both code and community plans.

* Please give us the main link to the projects primary website.

http://parrot.org

* Please give us a URL to a code repository we can clone and/or
checkout.

https://github.com/parrot/parrot

* Have you ever had funds held by the project, or by any individual
on behalf of the project?  How and for what did you spend those
funds?

We currently have a single bank account that holds some donations
we got a few years back. I think there is a sum of around $10K USD currently.

* Does your project owe funds to anyone?

Not to my knowledge, although we do have a few recurring small
expenses, such as a fax number, lawyers fees to file reports and taxes and a PO box.

* Has your project ever had legal trouble, been involved in legal
proceedings or received a letter accusing your project of patent,
copyright, trademark or other types of infringement?

Not to my knowledge.

* Please give a brief history of the project, focusing on how the
community developed and the general health of the community.  Be sure
to include information on any forks or other disputes that have
occurred in the community.

Parrot started as a new virtual machine for Perl 6 in 2001. It gradually become
a seperate project which aimed to be a virtual machine for all dynamic
languages, since Perl 6 wanted to support just about every feature a dynamic
language would want.

Originally there was a CVS repo, which was converted to Subversion many years
ago, which was converted to Git+Github by Jonathan "Duke" Leto. During the
Subversion Middle Ages, many projects "left the nest" and started being
developed in seperate repositories, outside what is currently called parrot.git
or "Parrot Core"

https://github.com/parrot/parrot

All the projects that were once in Parrot (plus more, that started independently)
are part of the Aviary a.k.a the Parrot Github Organization:

https://github.com/parrot

Only people who have signed Parrot Foundation CLAs have commit bits to the above
"Parrot Core" and "Parrot Aviary".

* Please explain how your project is governed.  Who makes the
decisions in the project?  How do you resolve disputes,
particularly about non-code issues?

Currently there is a Board of Directors that has a private mailing list
parrot-directors.

* If your project runs on Linux-based systems, please list all the
distributions that include your project, and what "repository area"
the package appears in.  If you aren't packaged for any major
distributions, please tell us why you believe your project hasn't
been packaged yet.

We are packaged on just about every major GNU/Linux distribution.
You can see a list of all the package systems we are in here:

https://github.com/parrot/parrot/tree/master/ports

* Does your project have any existing for-profit or non-profit
affiliations, funding relationships, or other agreements between the
project and/or key leaders of your project and other
organizations?  Has the project had such affiliations in the past?
Please list of all of them in detail and explain their
nature. Even tangential affiliations and relationships should be
included.

* Approximately how many users does your project have, and what items
lead you to believe your userbase is of a particular size (e.g., post
counts to your user mailing list)?

Our biggest "user" is Rakudo Perl 6, which itself has many developers
(which are our users) and dozens to hundreds of users (which are our
users once removed.)

* Please list the names, email addresses, and affiliations (e.g.,
employer) of key developers and major contributors.  Include both
current and past contributors and developers.  Please include date
ranges of when those developers/contributors were active.
