Parrot Foundation is proud to be a part of Google Summer of Code 2011!

Parrot was awarded 7 slots this year, which is awesome, considering this is the
first year Parrot Foundation is a separate organization. In previous years,
Parrot Foundation and The Perl Foundation were both a part of GSoC under a
single mega-umbrella organization.

This year, after experiencing being the org admin for the mega-umbrella
organization for two years, I felt that they could stand on their own feet.
Florian Ragwitz dutifully volunteered to herd cats for The Perl Foundation at
just the right time, so I wrote the org application and then handed it off to
him.  All of the awesome stuff you see relating to TPF and GSoC 2011 is a
result of his hard work.

Without further delay, here are the awesome projects that will be coding in
the GSoC spotlight this summer:

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/kpolulak/1">New Parrot Debugger</a>
Student: <a href="https://github.com/soh_cah_toa">Kevin Polulak</a>
Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/cotto">Cristoph Otto</a>

This is a sorely needed project. I wrote many tests for the Parrot debugger,
but due to design decisions before I arrived, many features are just not
implementable. This proposal will build on the work of a GSoC project from last
year (Parrot-Instrument) and redesign a Parrot debugger that is much more
flexible and featureful.

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/lucian1900/1">Python3 on Parrot</a>
Student: Lucian Branescu Mihaila
Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/allisonrandal">Allison Randal</a>

This is a very interesting proposal to make PyPy and Parrot place nice and have
a mostly self-hosted Python 3 implementation on Parrot VM.

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/brian_gernhardt/1">Migrating PAST to NQP and newPOST</a>
Student: <a href="https://github.com/Benabik">Brian Gernhard</a>
Mentor: <a href="http://blog.bacek.com">Bacek</a>

This proposal is about improving how Parrot compiler internals work, by rewriting
PAST (which is currently written in PIR) in NQP, a higher-level language, as well
as migrating to a new version of Parrot Opcode Syntax Tree (POST).

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/tylercurtis/1">A Look-Ahead(1) Left-to-Right Parser Generator for Parrot</a>
Student: <a href="https://github.com/ekiru">Tyler Curtis</a>
Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/darbelo">darbelo</a>


Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/bubaflub/1">Parrot bindings for GNU Multiprecision (GMP) integer functions</a>
Student: <a href="https://github.com/bubaflub">Bob Kuo</a>
Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/leto">Jonathan "Duke" Leto</a>

This project will add GMP integer function bindings to Parrot, which will allow all dynamic languages
running on Parrot access to these functions! This is a huge savings in terms of obviating the need
for every dynamic language needing to create a binding. Having GMP integer function bindings is also
a necessary step in implementing native Parrot cryptography and number theory libraries.

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/rohit_nsit08/1">Javascript on Parrot (code-named Corella)</a>
Student: <a href="https://github.com/">Rohit Jangid</a>
Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/coke">Will "Coke" Coleda</a>

A self-hosted Javascript on Parrot. Can you imagine it? This proposal aims to make it a reality. It builds upon many already-existing
Javascript libraries.

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/cggaertner/1">GObject interoperability for Parrot</a>
Student: <a href="https://github.com/cgaetner">Christoph GÃ¤tner</a>
Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/whiteknight">Andrew Whitworth</a>

This proposes to add GObject bindings to Parrot, which is the first necessary step to gain access to GNOME and
many other projecs. It is also a very useful binding in it's own right.

Honorable Mention:

Title: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/bbatha/1001">Java bytecode for Parrot</a>
Mentor: Ben Batha

This was a strong proposal, but we just couldn't find an appropriate mentor in
time which we felt would give Ben the proper experience, so we sadly had to
reject this proposal. Being an org admin ain't all whipcream and cherries.

We are currently in the Bonding Period, which goes until XXXX, when the Coding
Period begins. The coding period is from XXXXX to YYYYY, with a mid-term
evaluation due by ZZZZZ

If you would like to get involved with any of these projects or Parrot in general,
you are invited to #parrot on irc.parrot.org and the parrot-dev and parrot-users mailing lists.
