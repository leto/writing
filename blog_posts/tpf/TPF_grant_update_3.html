The quest to improve test coverage for src/extend_vtable.c has continued. Some dragons
were slayed, a few trolls were paid tolls to cross creaky bridges of abstraction and
many siren calls to hack on other code were dutifully ignored.

This TPF grant has forced me to become very familiar with Parrot vtables (virtual tables),
which is basically an API for talking to Parrot PMCs (really just objects with a funny
name). PMC can stand for Parrot Magic Cookie or PolyMorphic Container. Take your pick.

Firstly, vtable is already slang for "vtable function", which expands to "virtual table function."
What the junk is a "virtual table function" ? I find that the simplest way to think about
it is that every PMC has <i>slots</i> or <i>buckets</i> with standardized names such as
<b>get_bool</b> (get Boolean value) or <b>length</b> (what is the length of this PMC?). 

All PMCs inherit sensible defaults for most vtables, but they are allowed to
override them. Why would you want to override them? As a simple example, if we
had a complex number PMC that was really just an FixedNumberArray of two
numbers underneath, the <b>length</b> would always return 2 for every complex
number. Not very useful.

A much more useful <b>length</b> vtable would use the coefficients <b>a</b> and
<b>b</b> from <b>a + b*i</b> and compute the Euclidean distance (length from
the origin) <b>sqrt(a^2 + b^2)</b>).  Hopefully you now have a taste for what
what vtables are about. Parrot PMCs have over 100 vtables that can be
overridden to provide custom functionality.

I recently ran across the <b>hashvalue</b> vtable and couldn't find any tests
for it in Parrot core (outside of the test that I had written for it in
extend_vtable.t) or any use of it in Rakudo Perl 6. Oh noes! It seemed like an
unused feature, so I created a Trac Ticket to mark it as deprecated so it could
be removed in a future release.

The discussion about the ticket was fierce. NotFound++ explained why the vtable
was important and the might coding robot known as bacek++ manifested tests quickly.

Yet another case of this grant work having a positive impact on the Parrot codebase,
even outside the embed/extend interface.
