The quest to improve test coverage for src/extend_vtable.c has continued. Some dragons
were slayed, a few trolls were paid tolls to cross creaky bridges of abstraction and
many siren calls to hack on other code were dutifully ignored (mostly).

</p>
<p>
This <a href="http://perlfoundation.org">TPF</a> grant has forced me to become very familiar with Parrot vtables (virtual tables),
which is basically an API for talking to Parrot <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/master/docs/pdds/pdd17_pmc.pod">PMCs</a> 
(really just objects with a funny
name). PMC can stand for Parrot Magic Cookie or PolyMorphic Container. Take your pick.

</p>
<p>
Firstly, vtable is already slang for "vtable function", which expands to "virtual table function."
What the junk is a "virtual table function" ? I find that the simplest way to think about
it is that every PMC has <i>slots</i> or <i>buckets</i> with standardized names such as
<b>get_bool</b> (get Boolean value) or <b>length</b> (what is the length of this PMC?). 

</p>
<p>
All PMCs inherit sensible defaults for most vtables, but they are allowed to
override them. Why would you want to override them? As a simple example, if we
had a complex number PMC that was really just an <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/master/src/pmc/fixedfloatarray.pmc">FixedFloatArray PMC</a> 
of two
numbers underneath, the <b>length</b> would always return 2 for every complex
number. Not very useful.

</p>
<p>
A much more useful <b>length</b> vtable would use the coefficients <b>a</b> and
<b>b</b> from <b>a + b*i</b> and compute the Euclidean distance (length from
the origin) <b>sqrt(a^2 + b^2)</b>). Hopefully you now have a taste for what
what vtables are about. Parrot PMCs have over 100 vtables that can be
overridden to provide custom functionality.

</p>
<p>
I recently ran across the <b>hashvalue</b> vtable and couldn't find any tests
for it in Parrot core (outside of the test that I had written for it in
extend_vtable.t) or any use of it in <a href="http://rakudo.org">Rakudo Perl 6</a>. Oh noes! It seemed like an
unused/untested feature, so I created a <a href="http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2027">Trac Ticket</a> to mark it as deprecated so it could
be removed in a future release.

</p>
<p>
The discussion about the ticket was fierce. <a href="https://github.com/NotFound">NotFound++</a> explained why the vtable
was important and the mighty coding robot known as <a href="https://github.com/bacek">bacek++</a> manifested tests quickly.
</p>

<p>
Yet another case of this grant work having a positive impact on the Parrot codebase,
even outside the embed/extend interface. I also <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/commit/612ec787dc975c4d570fb9b95d5f9fbd2993e92a">improved an error message in the PMCProxy PMC</a>,
which arises when something goes bad during a partial re-compile. Yay for improved debuggability!
</p>
<p>
According to the current <a href="http://tapir2.ro.vutbr.cz/cover/latest-c_cover/src-extend_vtable-c.html">code coverage statistics</a>,
extend_vtable.c is up to 54% coverage from 43%,
which is not quite where I predicted from my last update. No doubt this has something to
do with me packing and preparing to move to a new house this month. My velocity didn't
decrease so much as the amount of time that I had to work on this grant.
</p>
<p>
I am greatly enjoying working on this grant and even if it is going a bit slower than I had planned, I am very confident that it will be completed in the next few months and hopefully sooner.
