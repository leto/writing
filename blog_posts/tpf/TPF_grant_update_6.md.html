<h1>Yet Another TPF Parrot Embed/Extend Grant Update</h1>

<p>I am excited to announce that I have completed my next grant milestone!  I
recently increased test coverage of extend_vtable.c to over 95% (
<a href="http://tapir2.ro.vutbr.cz/cover/latest-c_cover/src-extend_vtable-c.html">95.5%</a> to be
exact), achieving the milestone with a half percent buffer. It definitely
wasn't easy, but I changed the way I was approaching writing tests and it
resulted in a <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/compare/5dd8c543ab...8c04cc3e66">huge burst of
productivity</a>.</p>

<p>I went through a test coverage report and wrote down, on an actual piece of
<em>paper</em>, every function that had no test coverage. This allowed me to circle
the functions that I thought would be easiest to write tests for, and quickly
got those out of the way. I then went for uncovered functions that were similar
to already covered functions, and then finally I got to the hard functions.</p>

<p>This was a fruitful exercise, because it was decided by Parrot developers that
some VTABLE functions escaped accidentally and that they should be removed from the public API.
Whiteknight++ <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/commit/cbfc76e64acf9f0a526b5f7da0e4c6c4ec0d1189">removed Parrot_PMC_destroy (extra points for humor)</a>, which I was using incorrectly in the
extend_vtable tests and which was actually coredumping Parrot, but only on certain
platforms. I then removed <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/commit/cd1edef38c9f7d4af8ec3229fa166e4fe92d21f6">Parrot_PMC_mark</a> and <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/commit/44a9634f2764ccccfd7a5cbad1552159fc73bff8">Parrot_PMC_invoke</a>, the first being
an implementation detail of the garbage collector, and Parrot_PMC_invoke because
it was the only function that returned a '''Parrot_Opcode_t*''' and basically
not fit for public consumption.</p>

<p>I also <a href="http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2126">created a ticket (TT#2126)</a>
for a bug in the Parrot_PMC_morph function, which
has some possibly buggy but definitely unspecified behavior.</p>

<p>The remaining, untested functions in extend_vtable are clone_pmc, cmp_pmc,
get_pointer_keyed_int, get_pointer_keyed_str, remove_vtable_override,
set_pointer_keyed and set_pointer_keyed_str. I leave the testing of these
functions as an exercise to the interested reader :)</p>

<h2>Grant Refactoring</h2>

<p>This reminds me of a saying, I can't remember it exactly, but it is something
about the best laid plans of camels and butterflies often taste like onions.
Anyway, since I wrote my grant, the Parrot Embed API was deprecated and replaced
with a shinier and better documented system. After talking with cotto++ and
whiteknight++ on IRC, it was decided that working on test coverage for the new
embed API was a better use of resources than writing tests for the old embed
API that my original grant referred to, which will most likely be removed from
Parrot soon.</p>

<p>The new embed API is called <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/master/src/embed/api.c">src/embed/api.c</a>
and the plan is to replace my grant milestone of 95% coverage of embed.c with 95% coverage
of embed/api.c, which is currently at <a href="http://tapir2.ro.vutbr.cz/cover/latest-c_cover/src-embed-api-c.html">72%</a> coverage.</p>

<p>To summarize, I have two grant milestones left, increasing extend.c (currently
at <a href="http://tapir2.ro.vutbr.cz/cover/latest-c_cover/src-extend-c.html">61%</a> )
and embed/api.c to 95% coverage.</p>

<p>Given the lessons learned from testing extend_vtable and based on the fact that
I have already <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/commit/b59b869c9dd6f51109aa41e495082e09844ba348">made some
headway</a>,
my new estimate for these milestones is three weeks each. To make this more
definite, I plan to be done with this grant work by July 15th.</p>

<p>This is the home stretch! I can feel it in my bones.</p>
