This wayward son is still on his treacherous journey to increase 
<a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/master/t/src/extend_vtable.t">test coverage in
src/extend_vtable.c</a>. When we last left off our traveler, he explained what the mythical
VTABLE beast looked like, and we shall continue with the study of this chimerical
fauna.

According to the latest code coverage statistics, we are now at <a href="http://tapir2.ro.vutbr.cz/cover/latest-c_cover/src-extend_vtable-c.html">64% code coverage</a>, which is an increase of about 10% since my last report.

Most of this grant work concentrated on vtables that required 
<a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/src/pmc/key.pmc.html">Key PMCs</a>. A Key PMC is
an object that can be used to look something up in a <a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/src/pmc/hash.pmc.html">Hash PMC</a> or other aggregated object
that supports "keyed access". It is very much similar to a "hash key" that can be used
to look up the appropriate value.

One of the lessons that I have learned in working on these tests is that it is very
easy to write tests that pass on gcc, but which <a href="http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2084">absolutely explode with g++</a>. This
has to do with gcc not being as strict when some questionable type casting is done.
I have learned my lesson and I promise not to break the test suite anymore. I will
use g++ in my testing from now one, promise!

My productivity was definitely hampered by moving to a new house and having a two week
business trip in the last month, but my new home office is finally set up, so I expect
productivity to approach previous levels of adding a few dozen tests per week.
