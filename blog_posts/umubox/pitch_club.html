Umubox is about a month old and looking back, we have accomplished many things.  We will be presenting at Oregon Entrepeneurs (OEN) Angel Oregon 2011 on March 6th, 2011, which is very exciting. I have been busy with stuff related to the structure of our business, legal paperwork (pre-incorporation agreements), writing PostgreSQL schemas, helping with market research (like Leslie needs help) and a thousand other things. Somehow the Umubox co-founders get this done in our alotted 10 hours a week. This involves some unicorn-flavored secret sauce that is patent-pending.

Recently I saw an interesting Portland startup-ish event called Pitch Club, which was taking place at Urban Airship. I rode my bicycle over the Broadway Bridge to the west side, where most Portland tech startups seem to migrate.  The event was organized by Alexis Peterka and had five attendees. The first rule of Pitch club was "If this is your first night, you *have* to pitch!".

My goal was to attendee the meeting as a fly on the wall and study how people pitched their companies and what feedback they got. Since I didn't feel comfortable pitching Umubox yet, I pitched one of my countless side projects, Troll University.  I started Troll University with Selena and Bart during the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit 2010. Troll University is an institution that is dedicated to teaching troll management practices to businesses and individuals who are targeted by trolls.

I learned a lot about how to pitch a startup that night, but there were three key facts that stood out:

Don't start a pitch with a statistic. Describe a solution first, and then cite a relavent statistic. Otherwise, when the statistic is heard, it has no frame of reference.

Do start a pitch with a "hook", which is usually a problem with a clear solution.

Don't vilify the competition, the customer has no interest in it. Instead, concentrate on increasing value to customers.

In other news, I am the CTO of Umubox, so shouldn't I be thinking about the technology running Umubox? How many hats are you wearing? The answer is: about three at any given time. I have been designing PostgreSQL schemas and contemplating implementing some basic Umubox tech infrastructure in either Drupal or Django. Maybe you have a compelling reason why we should use one or the other? Please leave your suggestions in the comments and they will be carefully considered.

We have all of our phase 0 features specc'ed out and now it is a Simple Matter of Programming to make stuff work. This is where the meat hits the road, as they say. Also, I need to choose a bug tracker that doesn't make everyone hate the universe. Do you have a suggestion?  I would love to hear them.

PS: Watch closely for a post from Jen about our experience in the OEN Angel Oregon.
