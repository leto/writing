# What question do you feel like you're fielding most in your everyday job?

"What is the secret sauce to learning to program?" is probably the most common
question that I get.  The answer is there is no single secret or magic sauce,
but there is a lovely buffet with thousands of sauces, each with optimal uses,
marginal uses and down-write tragic mis-uses. Learning programming is a journey
of tasting those sauces and knowing when to use each one.

# If you had a 3d printer, what would be the first thing you would create?

I would make a factory that automatically printed 3D-printers, which
manufactured robots which make websites which sell the 3D-printers and then
donate 50% of the profits to charity and send the other half to me :)

# What is your favorite technology/IT news website?

IRC :)

# What's the best piece of advice you've ever received from a student? 

The best lesson and advice that I have learned is this: Everybody comes from a
different place, has gone through different experiences and learns best in
unique ways. If a teacher is not customizing the curriculum to each student,
something is not quite as good as it could be.

## Or if not a student, an instructor? Or if not either of these, from anyone at anytime?

Always clarify the definitions of words, especially in extremely specific
sub-fields where common words mean something completely different and
(sometimes) seemingly arbitrary. For instance, the word "set" is a very
ambiguous, almost useless English words. It has hundreds of meanings in the dictionary,
and then probably many more in colloqiual uses.

But in "mathematics", the word set is an extremely specific mathematical structure, with
a specific set of axioms, rules, theorems and algorithms. When a mathematician says "set",
there is no ambiguity at all. Always define your terms :)

# If you could have one superpower, what would it be?

I would like to be able to speak all languages, of all kinds, including
programming languages, spoken languages, sign languages and all the others.
