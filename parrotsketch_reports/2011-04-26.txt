What I did:
    * GSoCy things. Congrats to all our students!
    * Reported some failures on plobsing++'s branch
    * Worked on my TPF grant for the embed/extend system. Currenlty have
    test coverage over 70%.
    * Started a new branch to port PL/Parrot to the new embed API: https://github.com/leto/plparrot/tree/new_api
    * Started writing a META.json fil for PL/Parrot so it can be distributed on pgxn.org
What I will do:
    * More of the above stuff.
Blockers:
