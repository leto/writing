    * Working on my "Visual Intro to Parrot Virtual Machine" talk that I will give tomorrow
    * Git cloned winxed and Rosella for the first time and played around with them
    * Got a commit bit to Rosella
    * Fixed a bug in the Rosella test suite where the memoize tests failed on 32bit machines
    * Talked with cotto++ and chromatic++ about what language should be used to generate M0 code
    * Met with cotto++, particle++ and kid51++ and talked about Parrot Foundation stuff
    * Contacted the Software Freedom Conservancy ( http://sfconservancy.org ) about Parrot
      joining their ranks, so we don't have parrot hackers attempting to IRS paperwork and other non -Ofun stuff
What I will do:
    * Attend the Parrot/Perl 6 BOF tonight
    * Give my talk tomorrow
    * Attend the Parrot hackaton on Thursday
