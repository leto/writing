What I did:
    * Gave bubaflub++ a passing midterm grade
    * Started hacking on Chimera, a firefox plugin using the FireBreath framework,
      to embed Parrot in FF: https://github.com/letolabs/chimera
    * Got our netbsd smoker on the GCC compile farm working again, kid51++ for noticing
    * Hacked on parrot-libgit2 bindings, currently trying to make a Winxed test pass
    * Greatly improved the readme for the Parrot test suite:
        https://github.com/parrot/parrot/tree/master/t
What I will do:
    * Hack on PL/Parrot because I am giving a talk on it in a few days
Blockers:
    * meatspace
.EOR
