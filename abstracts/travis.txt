Utilizing Travis CI

There is an exciting new open source project called Travis CI that is also a
*free* service which provides continuous integration as a service. It makes it
trivially easy for any open source project on Github to start testing every
commit of their code, without ever touching Hudson, Jenkins or any other scary
CI systems.

This is accomplished by adding a single configuration file to each git repo,
which is a tiny bit of YAML that tells Travis how to run the tests for your code.
This also has the added benefit of your CI configuration being under version control,
instead of a forgotten config file sitting in a random place on your test server.

This talk with be a brief introduction to CI and why it is so hard to setup and
maintain for small projects as well as a more in-depth dive into making your
own tests run on Travis CI. Examples will be shown for Ruby, Python, Perl and
C-based projects. Other examples and languages will be shown if time allows.
