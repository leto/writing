So many amazing things happened at GSoC 2010! I will try to
jot a few of them down, before they leave for warmer climates.

Parrot on RTEMS hacking with Chris Johns and Ralf from RTEMS.
Used Centos 5 RPMS on Ubuntu 10.04 with rpm2cpio piped
to cpio, which was a trick to get around the fact that RTEMS
does not have debian packages. It worked remarkably well.
I had a cross-compilation environment setup after a few minutes.

Chromatic, Chris Johns and I sat in a room and talked shop
about how Parrot and RTEMS can play nicely together. There are
still some feature voids on the Parrot side to fill:

    - Parrot calls exit() in various places, which reboots RTEMS
    - i.e. a syntax error reboots the OS -> not fun
    - Parrot needs a configure step to detect RTEMS, I created
      TT#1840 for this

I gave an advanced trolling session.
