<p>
On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 5.0.0, also known
as "Johnny Five Alive".  Parrot (http://parrot.org/) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.
</p>

<p>
Parrot 5.0.0 consists of 175 new commits from six authors on the master branch
since the 4.11.0 release. Notably, this is the first stable release of Parrot
with thread support (via the Task PMC).
</p>

<p>
Parrot 5.0.0 is available on Parrot's FTP site
(ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/supported/5.0.0/), or by following the
download instructions at http://parrot.org/download.  For those who would like
to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using Git to
retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code.
