On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 4.9.0, also known
as "Proto-Hydra".  Parrot (http://parrot.org/) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.

Parrot 4.9.0 is available on Parrot's FTP site
(ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/4.9.0/), or by following the
download instructions at http://parrot.org/download.  For those who would like
to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using Git to
retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot 4.9.0 News:
    - Core
        + Keep encoding information in the imcc optimizer, which fixes the
          concat op but probably many more cases with non-ascii encoded
          constant strings. [GH #837]
        + Fixed ByteBuffer set_string_native, which became out of sync with
          two internal buffers. [GH #835]
        + Preload Configure steps when called with perl -d Configure.pl [GH #833]
        + Strip unneeded config keys from installed config hash. Saves 6360
          bytes from every installed executable. [GH #824]
        + Parrot_get_cpu_type returns now "unknown" for all unknown cpu types.
          On non-windows it returned before 4.9.0 a null string. [GH #846]
        + Fixed src/hash.c for platforms where size_t is unsigned (e.g. vms) [GH #854]
    - Build
        + Improved warnings for clang. [GH #843]
        + Cleaned wrong UNUSED(arg) macros in all pmc's due to an improved
          pmc2c compiler, which SHIMs all UNUSED args. [GH #836]
        + Added clang++ support and a new auto::alignof Configure step. [GH #844]
        + Fixed auto::inline for C++ compilers
        + Improved auto::llvm
    - Branches
        + The threads branch is almost ready to be merged. Some remaining races
          have been fixed. There are only some remaining platforms errors on
          darwin/x86.
    - Libraries
        + Fixed Mime::Base64: Split long lines at 76 chars. [GH #826]
          Support multi-byte codepoints. Use binary encoding,
          encoded files are now endian specific [GH #813 + #814],
          Added 2nd optional encoding arg to decode_base64().
    - Documentation
        + Cleaned up removed parrot cmdline options -D/-O/-v from --help output and
          running.pod [GH #838]
    - Tools
        + Improved gdb pretty-printing for multi-byte strings
