<p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 4.9.0,
also known as &quot;Proto-Hydra&quot;. <a href="http://parrot.org/">Parrot</a>
is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Parrot 4.9.0 is available on <a href="ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/4.9.0/">Parrot's FTP
site</a>, or by <a href="http://parrot.org/download">following the download
instructions</a>. For those who want to hack on Parrot or languages that run on top of Parrot,
we recommend <a href="https://github.com/parrot">our organization page</a> on GitHub,
or you can go directly to the official Parrot Git repo on <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot">Github</a>

To clone the Parrot Git repo into a directory called 'parrot', use the following:
<pre>
    git clone git://github.com/parrot/parrot.git
</pre>

If you want it to be in a directory other than 'parrot', then just give that as a second
argument to clone:
<pre>
    git clone git://github.com/parrot/parrot.git parrot_foo
</pre>

<p>Parrot 4.9.0 News:<br/>
<pre>
    - Core
        + Keep encoding information in the imcc optimizer, which fixes the
          concat op but probably many more cases with non-ascii encoded
          constant strings. [GH #837]
        + Fixed ByteBuffer set_string_native, which became out of sync with
          two internal buffers. [GH #835]
        + Preload Configure steps when called with perl -d Configure.pl [GH #833]
        + Strip unneeded config keys from installed config hash. Saves 6360
          bytes from every installed executable. [GH #824]
        + Parrot_get_cpu_type returns now "unknown" for all unknown cpu types.
          On non-windows it returned before 4.9.0 a null string. [GH #846]
        + Fixed src/hash.c for platforms where size_t is unsigned (e.g. vms) [GH #854]
    - Build
        + Improved warnings for clang. [GH #843]
        + Cleaned wrong UNUSED(arg) macros in all pmc's due to an improved
          pmc2c compiler, which SHIMs all UNUSED args. [GH #836]
        + Added clang++ support and a new auto::alignof Configure step. [GH #844]
        + Fixed auto::inline for C++ compilers
        + Improved auto::llvm
    - Branches
        + The threads branch is almost ready to be merged. Some remaining races
          have been fixed. There are only some remaining platforms errors on
          darwin/x86.
    - Libraries
        + Fixed Mime::Base64: Split long lines at 76 chars. [GH #826]
          Support multi-byte codepoints. Use binary encoding,
          encoded files are now endian specific [GH #813 + #814],
          Added 2nd optional encoding arg to decode_base64().
    - Documentation
        + Cleaned up removed parrot cmdline options -D/-O/-v from --help output and
          running.pod [GH #838]
    - Tools
        + Improved gdb pretty-printing for multi-byte strings
