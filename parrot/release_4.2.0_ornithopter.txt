"Technology, in common with many other activities, tends toward avoidance of
risks by investors. Uncertainty is ruled out if possible. Capital investment
follows this rule, since people generally prefer the predictable. Few recognize
how destructive this can be, how it imposes severe limits on variability and
thus makes whole populations fatally vulnerable to the shocking ways our
universe can throw the dice."

On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 4.2.0, also known
as "Ornithopter".  Parrot (http://parrot.org) is a virtual machine designed
to run all dynamic languages.

Parrot 4.2.0 is available on Parrot's FTP site
(ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/4.2.0/), or by following the
download instructions at http://parrot.org/download.  For those who would like
to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using Git to
retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot 4.2.0 News:
    - API Changes
        + The signature of getprop was changed from (PMC,String,PMC) to
          (PMC, PMC,String) for consistency
    - Core
        + Parrot Calling Conventions (pcc) now reuses Continuation PMCs
          internally, which reduces GC work by 25% and improves
          the fib.pir benchmark by 6%
        + Winxed snapshot updated to 1.6.devel 44a04cfa7b
        + Improved the detection of Clang-ish compilers during configuration
        + Fixed a possible segfault bug when reading packfiles with no
         constants or main_sub
        + By default, Parrot has now elevated these GCC warnings to errors
          during compile time:
            implicit-function-declaration, undef, missing-braces,
            nested externs, old-style-definition, strict-prototypes,
        + The OS Dynamic PMC now has separate functions to unlink a file
          and remove an empty directory (rmdir)
        + Fix building on Cygwin due to an improperly named DLL file
        + Various small bug fixes pointed out by static and dynamic analysis
          tools
    - Branches
        + Work on M0 continues now in the m0 branch, which contains both
          implementations (currently C and Perl) and specification.
        + Good progress has been made on the threads branch which builds
          on the green_threads branch. This gets Parrot much closer to
          being able to utilize multiple CPU cores seemlessly. More details

    - Documentation
        + New release manager documentation for parrot.github.com :
            http://git.io/parrot-github-guide
    - Community
        + Parrot was accepted to Google Summer of Code 2012!
