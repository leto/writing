## Bene Gesserit Test-Driven Litany

I must not fear testing. Fear of testing is the mind-killer. Fear of testing is
the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will
permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn
the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only my tests will remain.
